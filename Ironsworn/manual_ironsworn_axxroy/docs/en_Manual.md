# Ironsworn for Archipelago

*You stand, surrounded by your fellow townsfolk, bathed in the unearthly glow of the aurora. Bright as day in the midnight sky, the six rings of colored fire cast flickering shadows on the ground below. Some folk stare in wonder, others worry, but you know the truth. Your world is breaking. The strange howls of otherworldly monsters echo off the mountainsides, and the screams of terror confirm your fears. You must close the portal, or your world is doomed.*

## Intro

Ironsworn for Archipelago is a way to play a solo tabletop roleplaying game while integrated with the Archipelago multi-world randomizer.

Description of Archipelago from Archipelago.gg:
> This is a cross-game modification system which randomizes different games, then uses the result to build a single unified multi-player game. Items from one game may be present in another, and you will need your fellow players to find items you need in their games to help you complete your own.

Description of Ironsworn from IronswornRPG.com:
> In the Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying game, you are a hero sworn to undertake perilous quests in the dark fantasy setting of the Ironlands. Others live out their lives hardly venturing beyond the walls of their village or steading, but you are different. You will explore untracked wilds, fight desperate battles, forge bonds with isolated communities, and reveal the secrets of this harsh land.

Playing through this content, you play as an adventurer in the Ironlands during the Fracturing. The veil between worlds is breaking, and you must locate the 10 Shards of Reality to close the portal. Unfortunately, those shards have been scattered throughout the multiverse! You'll need to find the scattered items and knowledge in your world, and in return you'll receive items and knowledge from beyond the aurora to aid in your quest.

In order to save your world, you must: 
- Locate the 10 Shards of Reality
- Reforge them into the Reality Key
- Defeat the guardian of the Aurora, the Arch-demon Pelago

The tone of this module is more "gonzo" than a traditional Ironsworn campaign. You'll ally with Donald Duck who casts fireballs, learn swordplay from the hero of Hyrule, ride a Charizard into combat, and do battle with Mother Brain. The discordant nature of the content is intentional, and part of the fun is exploring how an iron age warrior would react to a Zergling, a pixellated diamond pickaxe, or a talking crocodile chef.

This content is designed to be used with Ironsworn, but could easily be adapted to work with any fantasy role-playing game you are more comfortable with. Modern, rules-light OSR games are easy to convert to, and Troika and Electric Bastionland are particularly well suited.
