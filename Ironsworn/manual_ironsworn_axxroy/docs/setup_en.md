# Ironsworn

## Set Up Archipelago

This integration uses the Manual Archipelago tool available [here](https://discord.gg/CWcxqxf3zJ) to integrate with a multiworld. For additional information about how to set up an archipelago multiworld, refer to the instructions available at https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/.

The `.yaml` file has two possible options you can modify:

- `delve` allows you to toggle on or off the content from the Ironsworn Delve expansion
- `game_override` allows you to override the normal way the game decides which types of content to send you. Normally it will only send you materials from other games in the same multiworld, but you can choose to limit or expand that list based on your personal preference.

## Set Up Ironsworn

The campaign setup for this is a little different than the base game. Follow the steps below to get started:

### 1. Create your world (page 194)
Establish the basic truths of your world using the tools provided (while keeping in mind the core conceit established above). 

### 2. Create your character (page 193)
As part of the Archipelago setup, you will be given 3 random starting Assets. Use these assets to inform your character's name and stat spread.

### 3. Create your background bonds (page 195)
Create your bonds as normal

### 4. Create your background vow (page 195)
Your background vow is always "Close the Aurora", and is always Extreme rank. You can make progress toward this goal as normal, but receiving a Shard of Reality always counts as 2 ticks of progress. You do not need to *Swear an Iron Vow* for this quest.

### 5. Receive your starting quest (page 199)
As part of the Archipelago setup, you will be given a random quest (quest text listed below). *Swear an Iron Vow* as usual to begin this quest.

### 6. Set the scene and bein play (pages 198 and 200)
Based on the outcome of your *Swear an Iron Vow* move, envision how your character begins and play to see what happens next.
