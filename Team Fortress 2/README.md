## How do I play this manual?

You will unlock each of the 9 mercenaries (2 are available to start) and 4 main game modes (Arena is available at the start). Each game mode has a certain way to unlock locations as described below. You may only play as characters you have unlocked, and achieving objectives with each character unlock different locations. You may play any map for any game mode you have unlocked.

### Goals

- Default: Victory is achieved when you locate all 41 Unusual Hats. Let's be honest, that's really what TF2 is about.
- Mann Co. Globetrotter: Win on all maps once
- Australium Hunt: Collect a set number of Australium to complete the game

### Traps

- Taunt Trap: Default taunt immediately 
- Killbind Trap: Use your killbind
- Pyrovision Trap: Equip Pyrovision Goggles for one round
- Schadenfreude Trap: Use your Schadenfreude Taunt (Do a default taunt if you don’t have one)

### Optional Settings

- MvM Enabled: adds MvM maps and game mode to the item pool. (Class and Weapon restrictions are disabled for these maps)
- Shuffle Weapons/Equipment: All weapons and gadgets are added to the item pool (This means you can be an Engineer with either only a PDA and can’t use guns or without a PDA and can’t build buildings or a Spy that can’t cloak or disguise [Disguise Kit can’t be in the starting weapon pool])
- Full Loadout: All classes start with a full loadout instead of one random weapon (Only applies to the Shuffle Weapon/Equipment setting)

## Game Modes

### Arena

In an Arena match, you cannot switch mercenaries. You unlock an AP location if you are part of the winning team, whether or not you survived the round.

### Capture the Flag

During CtF, you may switch to any mercenaries you have unlocked. You unlock locations of the merc you are playing when you achieve the objective. You unlock an AP location any time you:
- Successfully capture the Intelligence
- Successfully kill the enemy Intelligence carrier and the Intelligence returns to your base (the intel must fully return to base)

### Control Point, Attack/Defend & Payload

On a control point or payload map you may switch to any mercenaries you have unlocked. On any control point or payload map, you unlock a location for the merc you are playing whenever you successfully capture a control point or payload checkpoint. If you are the defending team and successfully defend a map, you unlock 2 locations for any merc you played during that game.

### King of the Hill

In a King of the Hill match, you cannot switch mercenaries. You unlock a location for each game you finish on the winning team.

## FAQ

### I want to play new and different loadouts and have more randomization!

There's a fantastic loadout randomizer here: https://genr8rs.com/Generator/Tf2/LoadoutGenerator

### What if I end up playing one of the weird maps?

Sorry, I'm not putting any locations on the Carnival of Carnage. Go play Wario World or something instead.

### I send too many deaths and my friends are mad at me

Git gud
