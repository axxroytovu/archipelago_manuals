# Betrayal at the House on the Hill

_Something dark lies at the heart of the house. The darkness spills from the windows, pouring out onto the overgrown lawn. You must find the source of the darkness, before it becomes unstoppable._

This scenario is based on the Treasure Hunt scenario from the main book, and by "A Solo Version of Betrayal" by Monsp1ke: https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/222029/a-solo-version-of-betrayal

## Setup

Choose a character card and set up the play area as described in the rulebook. Separate all of the locations as listed in the Location Packs section below, and shuffle the Starting Items into the base starting locations deck.

Your goal is to gather the three ritual components and bring them to the Pentagram Chamber and stop the darkness ritual. The three ritual components are the Angel Feather, the Holy Symbol, and the Book. You only have a certain amount of time before the house's corruption forces you away, so you may need to start over multiple times to reach your objective. To start out your timer starts at 3 turns; place the plastic clip on the 3 on the Turn/Damage track to represent the remaining turns. 

The evil aura of the house has drawn all manner of cursed creatures to the house. Take one of each small monster token (Goblin number 21, specter, ectoplasmic entity, were-creature, tentacle-spawn, zombie, and child of Kali) and place them in a bag. 

Put numbers 1-20 of the smaller red monster tokens in a bag. These tokens represent clues to help you with boons during your investigation. Clues may contain traps, so watch out!

Additionally, you can die at any time as if the Haunt was active.

## Exploring the house

You start in the entrance hall and can move up to your speed on your turn as normal.

When you discover a new room, pull from the location deck and follow the instructions below.

If the room has an Item, Event, or Omen icon in it, place one of the small monster tokens in that room with the number hidden. See the Clues section below for instructions on how to discover the clue.

If the room has an Event icon, draw a card from the Event deck and resolve it as normal. This ends your movement.

If the room has an Item or Event icon in it, unlock the corresponding Archipelago location. If the location has not been checked, this ends your movement. If the location has already been checked, you may continue moving through the room if you have enough speed.

If the room has no icons on it, place a random Small Monster token on that space. Follow the Monster Instructions. 

## Clues

Once per turn you may make a Knowledge roll to discover a clue on the board. Make a knowledge roll:
- 0-3: You find nothing. Leave the clue face down on the square
- 4-12: You find a clue! Flip over the token and reference the token's number against the table below.
- 13+: You find your own dead body. Did you die one of your previous times into the house? Turn over the clue and also draw an item card.

## Monster Rules

| Monster | Speed | Might | Sanity | Vulnerabilities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Goblin | 4 | *4* | 4 | Revolver, Axe, Blood Dagger |
| Specter | 3 | 5 | *5* | Candle, Bell, Sacrificial Dagger |
| Ectoplasmic Entity | 3 | *6* | 6 | Bell, Amulet, Sacrificial Dagger |
| Were-Creature | 5 | *5* | 4 | Music Box, Candle, Revolver |

| Zombie | 3 | *5* | 3 | Revolver, Axe, Music Box |
| Childe of Kali | 4 | *5* | 5 | Blood Dagger, Idol, Revolver |

Succeeding at an attack or defense against a monster will stun it. You may attack a monster only if you have one of its vulnerabilities. If you initiated the attack and succeed you stun the monster for 2 turns instead of 1 (you can mark this by placing one of the found clue tokens on top of it). 

At the end of each of your turns the Monster(s) take their turn. For each monster:
1. If the monster is stunned, un-stun it or remove the double-stun marker and end its turn. 
2. The monster moves its speed toward you.
3. The monster makes an attack on you with the highlighted stat.
